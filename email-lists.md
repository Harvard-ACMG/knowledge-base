# Subscribe to email lists

The Harvard-ACMG, GEOS-Chem, and SEAS communities use several email lists to share and disseminate information. These mailing lists are hosted by the SEAS Office of Computing.

You may subscribe to an email list by email or by the web interface as described below.

## Subscribing by email interface

All users can manage their mailing list subscriptions by sending email instructions to the server.

To subscribe to any of the email lists, send an email to:
```
LISTNAME+subscribe@g.harvard.edu
```
To unsubscribe from any of the email lists, send an email to:
```
LISTNAME+unsubscribe@g.harvard.edu
```
where `LISTNAME` is the name of the intended email list (e.g. `jacob-group`, `geos-chem`, etc.) You can leave the subject and body of the email blank if you wish.

When subscribing or unsubscribing to any of these lists, you will receive a confirmation email from the system. To activate your request, you must click on the link in the email.

## Subscribing by web interface

You can also use the Google Groups web interface to subscribe to any of the Jacob Group, GEOS-Chem, or SEAS mailing lists. Some relevant email list web interface links are listed below.

| Email list     | Web interface                                                      |

To view other available email lists, point your browser to <https://groups.google.com/a/g.harvard.edu/forum/#!forumsearch/>.

After clicking on the web interface link, you will be brought to the appropriate Google Groups page. If you do not already belong to the email list the page will say "You must be signed in and a member of this group to view and participate in it." Click on the **Subscribe to this group** link. Enter your email address and the CAPTCHA validator then click **Subscribe**. If the process was successful you should then see a box at the bottom of your browser saying "Subscribe confirmation email sent to (your email address)." When you receive the confirmation email from the system, follow the instructions to complete the subscription process.

## Anti-spam measures

Each mailing list subscription request shall be approved by the list moderator. Requests from persons who are not recognized shall be discarded.

To prevent spam, the email lists will reject mail from unrecognized addresses. When sending an email message to a list, make sure that you send your message from the same email address under which you subscribed to that list. Otherwise your message may not get delivered.

If you change email addresses, please unsubscribe from each mailing list and resubscribe with your new email address.
