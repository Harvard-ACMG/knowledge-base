# Book a meeting in the Jacob Group Conference Room

We have created a Google calendar named **Jacob group conference room**, which is linked to the Jacob group email list
(`jacob-group@g.harvard.edu`). You can use this calendar to reserve the Jacob group conference room (Pierce 110E) for your research meetings and
telecons.

Permission to update the Jacob group conference room calendar is granted to all members of the Jacob group who:

1.  Have a valid `g.harvard.edu` email address, and
2.  Are subscribed to the Jacob group email list
    (`jacob-group@g.harvard.edu`)

If you are new to the Jacob group, then please contact Harvard University IT, who can set you up with a `g.harvard.edu` email address.
Then contact the GEOS-Chem Support Team, who can add you to the Jacob group email list.

## Adding events to the Jacob group conference room calendar

To reserve the conference room for a given date and time, simply add a
new event to the Jacob group conference room calendar:

**(1)** Log in to <https://calendar.google.com> with your
`g.harvard.edu` email address and password.

**(2)** Click on the date of your event. A popup box will ask you to add
an event title and time.

**(3)** Click on **More options** to further refine the event.

  - Add a **starting time** and **ending time** for your event.
  - Type **Jacob Group conference room (P110E)** in the location box.
  - IMPORTANT: Select the **Jacob group conference room** calendar.
      - The Google Calendar page will display all of your Google
        Calendars, as well as the Jacob group conference room calendar. 
      - This makes it very easy to place your event in the wrong
        calendar if you are not careful.
  - OPTIONAL: Add a description for your event in the **Add Description
    box**.
  - OPTIONAL: Invite other group members by typing their names in the
    **Add Guests** tab. Each guest will get an individual notification. 
      - Adding guests is not strictly necessary. Event notifications
        will be sent to the [Harvard ACMG Slack
        channel](/wiki/as/slack), which most group members can see.
  - Click **Save** to create the event.
