# Configuring a SEAS printer for your PC or Mac

The Jacob Group has its own dedicated printer. It is located in the
copier room across from Pierce 100F. (NOTE: This room should remain
locked. You can use your office key to get into the room.)

The printer information is:

``` 
  * Name: **jacobsgroup-prn** 
  * Driver: **Xerox Phaser 6280DN**
```

You also have the option of printing to the new Pierce Hall printer
**prc-1flr-clr2**. For a complete list of public printers available see

To add SEAS printers to your PC or Mac, follow the directions on the

any issues installing the printers, contact SEAS computing as
